###Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Data can be downloaded from here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Extract it in your working directory.

Execute the run_analysis.R script and it should output a csv file called Tidy.csv
